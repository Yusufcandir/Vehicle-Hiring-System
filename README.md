# Vehicle Hiring System README

## Project Overview
This project, assigned as Project #3 for the COMP1112 Object Oriented Programming course during the Spring 2023 semester, focuses on designing and implementing a Vehicle Hiring System for the VPark company. The system aims to manage various types of vehicles available for hire, including cars and trucks, each with specific features and rental options.

## Project Scope
The Vehicle Hiring System allows customers to rent vehicles for different time periods, with varying fees and additional costs. Some vehicles can be booked in advance, delivered to the customer's location, and dropped off at another location. The system handles both cars and trucks, catering to different transportation needs.
